* Create custom Widget that extends Textarea widget 
    and shows dynamically amount of symbols are writed in this field.
    Use this widget at form of creating new note and at admin interface(at note adding).
    Note: there are can be a few such widgets at one page.

* Add ability to attach an image to Note

* Show total count of notes. Use custom context processor to pass amount to every template.

* Add ability to add new text note. Do not allow to post note shorter that 10 symbols.

* Create a custom inclusion template tag that will render one text note by given id of note.

* Create 'book' model to store notes. Every note can occur in multiple books.

* Change form to Use Ajax to create new text note. 
    Note: all CSS and JS instructions should be in separate files, not in the HTML code.

* Add a widget that can be inserted in any web page. Widget should show random text note. 
    There should be a ability to generate HTML code of widget that can be inserted in another site.
    Note: do not bother yourself with checking that jquery is enabled at site. Assume that jquery is enabled.

* Create app that shows list of text notes.
    It is should be one page that show list of text notes. 
    At this moment notes can be added from django admin interface without any additional interface.
    Don't bother yourself with complex ui, let's use basic twitter bootstrap skeleton and styles.
